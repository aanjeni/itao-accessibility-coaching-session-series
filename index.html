<!-- alt text: Data on Disability in Canada, 2017

The Canadian Survey on Disability covers Canadians aged 15 years and over whose everyday activities are limited because of a long-term condition or health-related problem.

22% of Canadians had at least one disability. This represents 6.2 million people.

Percentage of Canadians with at least one disability

By sex
•Women: 24%
•Men: 20%

By age group 
•Youth aged 15 to 24 years: 13%
•Working-age-adults aged 25 to 64 years: 20%
•Seniors aged 65 years and over: 38%

By Disability type

Top four most common
•Pain-related: 15%
•Flexibility: 10%
•Mobility: 10%
•Mental health-related: 7%

Other disability types
•Seeing: 5%
•Hearing: 5%
•Dexterity: 5%
•Learning: 4%
•Memory: 4%
•Developmental: 1%

1.6 million Canadians with disabilities were unable to afford required aids, devices, or prescription medications due to cost.

Among youth with disabilities, 60% had a mental-health related disability.

Employment rates for working-age adults
•59% for persons with disabilities
•80% for persons without disabilities -->

                <p>By far the most common type of disability is cognitive disabilities. Cognitive disabilities can arise as a result of congenital conditions that are with an individual from birth, or developmental conditions that are with a person from a young age. They can also result from traumatic injury, infections, chemical imbalances, or other conditions later in life.</p>
                <p>In simple terms, a person who has a cognitive disability has trouble performing mental tasks that the average person would be able to do.</p>
